# Next Actions - Deployment Verification

## ✅ Completed Actions

1. **Code Committed and Pushed**
   - Commit: `28bc14a` (initial)
   - Fix commit: Latest (build fix)
   - Status: ✅ Pushed to `main` branch
   - Build: ✅ Local build successful

2. **Build Verification**
   - ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
   - ✅ No linting errors
   - ✅ All routes generated correctly
   - ✅ Syntax errors fixed

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Verify Vercel Deployment Status

**Check if deployment triggered automatically:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project: `seo-grader` or `TRI-TWO/seo-grader`
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for deployment with commit `28bc14a` or latest commit
5. Verify build status:
   - ✅ Green = Success
   - ⚠️ Yellow = Building
   - ❌ Red = Failed

**If deployment didn't trigger:**
- Check GitHub integration in Vercel settings
- Verify `main` branch is connected
- Manually trigger: `vercel --prod` (if CLI installed)

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to: Settings → Environment Variables
2. Verify these are set for **ALL environments** (Production, Preview, Development):

```
✅ SUPABASE_URL
✅ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY  
✅ UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL
✅ UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN
✅ AUDIT_VERSION (value: "1.0.0")
```

**Optional but recommended:**
```
⚠️ WORKER_SECRET (for worker endpoint security)
```

**Quick Check Script:**
```bash
# Run locally to see what's needed
./scripts/check-env-vars.sh
```

### Step 3: Test Deployment

**Once deployment is live, run:**

```bash
# Replace YOUR_APP_URL with your Vercel deployment URL
./scripts/test-deployment.sh https://YOUR_APP_URL
```

**Or test manually:**

```bash
# Test states endpoint
curl https://YOUR_APP_URL/api/states

# Test audit creation
curl -X POST https://YOUR_APP_URL/api/audit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
```

### Step 4: Verify Production Features

**Test Normal Audit:**
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Enter a test URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)
3. Should show loading states
4. Should display complete results
5. No infinite spinner

**Test Partial Audit (Blocking Site):**
1. Create audit for a site that blocks/timeouts
2. Should see:
   - ✅ Yellow warning banner
   - ✅ "This site blocked automated access. Partial audit displayed."
   - ✅ Job status: `done` (not `error`)
   - ✅ Partial results displayed

**Test Polling:**
1. Open browser DevTools → Console
2. Navigate to report page
3. Verify:
   - ✅ Only one polling interval
   - ✅ Polling stops when job is done
   - ✅ No navigation loops
   - ✅ No repeated console messages

### Step 5: Check Function Logs

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to: Functions → View Logs
2. Check for:
   - ✅ Successful job processing
   - ✅ Retry attempts (for blocked sites)
   - ✅ Partial audit cases handled
   - ❌ No unhandled errors
   - ❌ No function timeouts

**Key Functions to Monitor:**
- `/api/audit` - Job creation
- `/api/audit/[id]` - Status retrieval
- `/api/worker/process` - Job processing
- Cron job: `/api/worker/process` (hourly)

### Step 6: Database Verification

**In Supabase SQL Editor, run:**

```sql
-- Check for partial audits
SELECT 
  id,
  url,
  status,
  stage,
  partial_audit,
  error_message,
  created_at
FROM audit_jobs
WHERE partial_audit = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check job status distribution
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN partial_audit = true THEN 1 END) as partial_count
FROM audit_jobs
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## 📊 Monitoring Checklist

After deployment, monitor for 24-48 hours:

- [ ] Jobs completing successfully (not stuck)
- [ ] No excessive timeout errors
- [ ] Polling working efficiently
- [ ] Partial audits displaying correctly
- [ ] Normal audits completing
- [ ] Function performance acceptable
- [ ] No database connection errors

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check build logs in Vercel
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check for TypeScript errors
4. Review function logs

**If jobs are stuck:**
1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Verify cron job is running
3. Check Supabase connection
4. Verify Upstash Redis connection

**If partial audits not showing:**
1. Check browser console
2. Verify API response includes `partialAudit`
3. Check report page state management
4. Verify banner rendering logic
